/**
 * T4b - a run that always fails must be retried on a bounded budget, then dead-lettered,
 * and its row must be released back to {@code PENDING} on every failed attempt.
 *
 * <p>Mechanism under test, as measured on {@code master}: the injected failure is never
 * even reached. The consumer claims the row, then {@code runAsync} claims it again, the
 * second claim matches nothing and returns through the dummy-DTO branch without executing
 * (see T2), so the execution count is 0 rather than 1 and there is no failure to retry.
 * The row is then acked and left at {@code PROCESSING}.
 *
 * <p>A second, unrelated defect also sits behind the first. Spring Boot installs a
 * {@code DefaultErrorHandler} when the application configures none, and its default backoff
 * is {@code FixedBackoff(interval=0, maxAttempts=9)} with a {@code LoggingRecoverer}: ten
 * attempts, then the offset is committed and the record is dropped. No DLT is written and
 * no {@code FAILED} row appears. So the first post-fix red here is expected to be
 * "10 attempts, no DLT, row back at PENDING" rather than the rev.-3 prediction of one
 * attempt and a {@code FAILED} row — the retry budget, the DLT and the {@code FAILED}
 * transition are all unreachable today, for two independent reasons.
 *
 * <p>That corrects rev. 3 of the design note twice over. Rev. 3 assumed the injected failure
 * would fire; in fact F1 swallows the run before it has any effect. And it assumed no error
 * handler; in fact Boot's default handler retries ten times and then discards. This test
 * therefore pins the <em>fixed</em> contract, and its first red is F1 plus the retry policy.
 *
 * <p>Asserted invariants after the fix:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>exactly 3 attempts - one initial plus two retries;</li>
 *   <li>the row returns to {@code PENDING} on every failed attempt, so it is claimable
 *       again rather than stranded in {@code PROCESSING};</li>
 *   <li>the record reaches the DLT once the budget is exhausted;</li>
 *   <li>the row becomes {@code FAILED} only at DLT publication, from the record key.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Context is dirtied so the deliberately failing record cannot outlive this class.
