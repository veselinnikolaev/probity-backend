/**
 * Positive control for the whole async slice.
 *
 * <p>If this test fails, every other result in {@code me.veselin.probity.simulation.async} is
 * meaningless: a broken broker, a listener that never started, a claim UPDATE that does not
 * match, or a worker that claims but cannot execute would all look identical from the outside.
 *
 * <p>It used to be pinned at {@code PROCESSING}, on the reasoning that the claim is all this
 * test was about and {@link SimulationAsyncDuplicateDeliveryIntegrationTest} owned the
 * execution half. That reasoning turned out to hide two defects: on {@code master} the row
 * sat at {@code PROCESSING} because the worker claimed, failed to claim again, and returned
 * without executing — so a pipeline that could not run a single simulation passed this control.
 * It now asserts the full path through to a {@code COMPLETED} row carrying its result, which
 * is the property that was actually worth protecting.
