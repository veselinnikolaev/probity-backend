/**
 * T3a - a delivery that finds a <em>fresh</em> {@code PROCESSING} row must be nacked,
 * not acked, and must then reclaim and run exactly once. **The F2 proof.**
 *
 * <p>No container stop, no consumer-group rebalance, no {@code max.poll.interval.ms}
 * wait. The pre-seeded fresh {@code PROCESSING} row can only leave that state via
 * nack -&gt; broker redelivery -&gt; stale -&gt; claimed, so the assertion is unambiguous.
 *
 * <p>Mechanism under test (F2): the consumer acknowledges unconditionally when the claim
 * returns false. A row that is already {@code PROCESSING} looks exactly like "someone else
 * is on it", so the message is committed and destroyed. Had that peer died, the work is now
 * unrecoverable - the offset is committed and the record is never redelivered.
 *
 * <p>The committed consumer-group offset is the direct observable for the ack question.
 * It is reported in the failure message: on master it advances past the record that must
 * not have been acked.
